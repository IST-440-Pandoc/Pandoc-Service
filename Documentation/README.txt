This section is documentation taken by the IST 440 Capstone group that started this project. The final report is the final deliverable from the class that goes over each section of the project. As such, this is where you will find a summary of each part of the project as it progressed. The dashboards were a requirement by the IST 440 professor that consisted of weekly status updates throughout the semester. Final Report Supporting Docs contain more specific information such as the test scripts that were used, what file conversions worked and failed, technical specifications, and others. The Gantt chart is also present as well as the raw notes from each meeting conducted by the IST 440 group.
